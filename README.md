# BellaBeat_Analysis
This repository contains my analytics process for Google's Data Analysis capstone project. This project details the steps taken, methods used, tools, and programs utilized throughout the process. Visualizations were created using Python and Google Sheets. 

## Objective
To identify trends in BellaBeat Fitbit tracker and how these trends can be used for a marketing team.

## Overview and Purpose
Working with the data Bellabeat provided, my job is to examine the raw data and ask questions about what is being collected. From those questions, I can produce answers that can translate into marketable processes for current and future customers. A new or improved marketing approach will help BellaBeat increase profits and drive revenue. The analysis will take into consideration all aspects of data and annotate processes along the way, explain why certain methods are used, and where to go forward. 

This analysis from this dataset will produce visuals and tables that are easily understandable for any non-technical audience. Visuals will include bar charts and scatter plots representing different aspects of the data for relationship identification. Tables will be presented as a secondary means of relationship analysis. Both of these methods combined will inform the audience of the story behind the data, what it means, and what actionable steps can be taken to help improve the marketability of BellaBeat.

## Data Source
Data sets were generated by BellaBeat and posted on Kaggle.com [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit). All data used was pulled from this site and no other data was taken from any other source.

## Data Cleaning
The data cleaning process consisted of joining datasets pulled from the data source and splitting them into two separate periods. I joined them to encompass all data recorded for each user. Python and SQL were the most effective languages for cleaning data and transforming the data into meaningful and useful datasets. Cleaning methods in Python were used to check for duplicates, null values, outliers, and processing data. Certain columns proved irrelevant or redundant to answering some questions and those entries were cleaned.

## Data Models
Renditions from the analysis are below and show trends in variables. These models show the relationship between users' calories burned and their level of activity. Activity levels varied from sedentary, low, active, and very active.

The image below shows a negative trend for people who are sedentary and are more prone to burn less calories

The second image shows a positive trend to being very active nd burning more calories.

A question I analyzed more in-depth was about two users' weight journey from the data set. The users recorded their weights every day and I wanted to know if their activity had any relation to helping them achieve weight loss. Not only would it be beneficial to observe the trends these people had along the way, but also, if the calories burned helped them with their goal. One way doctors reccomend people to lose weight is to burn more calories, so I wanted to know if that helped these people lose weight. I examined the calories they burned to their weight.

The timeline below shows the first user's calories-burned journey.

The chart below shows the first user's weight journey. It is interesting to note how the trend is negative, however, this user's starting weight is lower than her end weight.

### SQL work done behind the scenes
In my technical notebook, I document when I use SQL to clean and transform data. I used SQL at times because it made joining, filtering, and selecting data much easier than with Python. The legibility of SQL also makes it easier to follow. Below are some of the queries that ran when using SQL.

This query shows I am selecting the Id, ActivityDay, while summing calories for each user and grouping the days together. In this dataset, there are multiple day entries for each user, so summing the calories to give me a one day total was important to generate a daily report.

Checking work for daily calories from the query ran above.  Calories were split into hourly burned rates, so I wanted to join them into a daily burned view by user. This query is checking my work for calories summed correctly.

This query is to exemplify using the union function for my data. For the sake of understanding what is in each table, the columns have been written out. All columns were written out, so using the "*" character would have saved time, however, for you the reader, it is best to know what is being unionized.

## Data Results
As a result of the data, we can conclude that increasing activity level has an impact on the amount of calories burned. It is more beneficial to exercise at higher intensities than to exercise at lower intensities. This has an impact on the amount of weight a person can lose as a caloric deficit has an impact on one's ability to lose weight. People who are sedentary burn fewer calories and this is expected as a user is at rest and not expending more energy than is necessary at rest.

## Briefing and Presentation
BellaBeat is able to market this product to its users with various fitness goals in mind as it tracks many important variables that can relate to any fitness goal. Personalized user data down to the minute is very useful for people who want to take an in-depth look at their health. Doctors and other medical professionals are able to look at someone's journey on a case-by-case basis to understand what factors are impacting their health. This would prove very useful for someone struggling with their health or to make the progress they are seeking. 

BellaBeat can market its product to a wide population as most people today want to be more aware of their health and fitness. Most people would like to take an actionable step to improve their health, so this product will help to merge a user's wants and needs.

## Future work
Many factors play into one's fitness journey, so exploring other key details would result in a more detailed analysis that can be more individualized. Analysis for an individual would be very useful in athletic settings such as bodybuilding, powerlifting, professional sports, and even for the regular gym goer who wants to be more fit. It would be useful for doctors to look at the data and be able to make recommendations based on a patient's goal or needs. 

Future data can be implemented such as caloric intake, fitness goals, mental health scores, and rest impact on fitness. All of these have a major impact on data meaning and interpretation. For our second user, their caloric intake may have shot up on the last few days of their journey, which is why their end weight was higher than their starting weight. Perhaps they had a bad mental health day, which also led them to an intake of more calories, or perhaps the amount of burned calories was too much and resulted in a poor mental state, which may have led to a yo-yo diet. We do not know each user's fitness goal, so maybe a user wants to gain weight in order to gain muscle. If this were the case, caloric intake needs to be higher than caloric output, so ensuring they maintain a surplus is important.
