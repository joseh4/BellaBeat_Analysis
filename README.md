# BellaBeat_Analysis
This repository contains my analytics process for Google's Data Analysis capstone project. This project details the steps taken, methods used, tools, and programs utilized throughout the process. Visualizations were created using Python and Google Sheets. 

# Objective: To identify trends in BellaBeat Fitbit tracker and how these trends can be used for a marketing team.

## Overview and Purpose
Working with the data Bellabeat provided, my job is to examine the raw data and ask questions about what is being collected. From those questions, I can produce answers that can translate to marketable processes for current and future customers. A new or improved marketing approach will help BellaBeat increase profits and drive revenue. The analysis will take into consideration all aspects of data and annotate processes along the way, explain why certain methods are used, and where to go forward from. 

This dataset will produce visuals tables easily understandable for any non-technical audience
